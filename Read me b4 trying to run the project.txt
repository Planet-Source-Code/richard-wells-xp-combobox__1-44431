Read me b4 trying to run the project

Attention VB6`ers
This example uses a subclassing component called SSUBTMR6.DLL which allows all of the mouse over and owner drawing stuff to happen.
This example wont work without it, if you don't have the .dll,  First go to 
http://www.vbaccelerator.com/home/VB/Code/Libraries/Subclassing/SSubTimer/article.asp and down load it. Second, install the .dll into you System directory then register the .dll using the many different registration tools available.
Third, Fire up the project and on the main menu click Project>References and browse for something that looks like this
vbAccelerator VB6 Subclassing and Timer Assistant (with configurable message response, multi-control support + timer bug fix) and check it in the list if you cant find it click the browse button and look for the .dll in your system directory. If all goes well here the project should work.



Attention VB5`ers
There are both VB6 and VB5 Versions of the .dll available at the site.
The above procedure is the same only the .dll and description is different although you will have to make a modification to the cXPCombo class

My example looks like this

Private Property Let ISubclass_MsgResponse(ByVal RHS As SSubTimer6.EMsgResponse)
    '
End Property

Private Property Get ISubclass_MsgResponse() As SSubTimer6.EMsgResponse
    If (CurrentMessage = WM_TIMER) Then
        ISubclass_MsgResponse = emrPostProcess
    Else
        ISubclass_MsgResponse = emrPreprocess
    End If
End Property

You need to do this

Private Property Let ISubclass_MsgResponse(ByVal RHS As SSubTimer.EMsgResponse)
    '
End Property

Private Property Get ISubclass_MsgResponse() As SSubTimer.EMsgResponse
    If (CurrentMessage = WM_TIMER) Then
        ISubclass_MsgResponse = emrPostProcess
    Else
        ISubclass_MsgResponse = emrPreprocess
    End If
End Property

Just remove the 6 at the end of the SsubTimer6 and all should work
Good luck.

Will reply if you get into trouble.
